# Lets-Chat
A real-time chat app made with socket.io

# Socket-io
- [socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [socket.io Documentation](https://socket.io/docs/)
- Socket.io uses websockets that provide a persistent connection between the client and the server.
    - The connection is full-duplex, meaning both the client and the server can send data to each other.
    - This makes bidirectional communication possible.
- We can emmit an event from the client to the server.
- The server can listen for the event from the client.
- The server can then emit another event to others.
    - It also has rooms.

## If you want to use the app locally for testing and learning puposes use the dev branch
